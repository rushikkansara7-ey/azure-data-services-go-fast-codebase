Thanks for your interest in contributing to the https://github.com/microsoft/azure-data-services-go-fast-codebase project.

We're happy that this site is open source (because an open source site should be open source). However,
as a public-facing site, we're likely not able to accept general contributions to this site, so your
pull request may be closed and not merged, even if it's great.

Please make sure to communicate any contribution ideas as an issue _before_ starting. We'd love to see
how to involve you.
